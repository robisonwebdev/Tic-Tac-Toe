# Tic-Tac-Toe - [Live Preview](https://robisonwebdev.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/)

## Objective
Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of this project was to tuck
as much of the code as possible away inside of a module or factory.

## Thoughts
- I feel that I have accoplished the main objective of this project. I've manage to tuck everything away inside a module or
a function.

- The biggest challenge I faced was trying to figure out how to create players inside a module while using a factory function. I 
manage to overcome this problem by setting a variable outside on the createPlayer() and storing the new players to said variables.

- The logic of figuring out the winner of the game wasn't as difficult as I imagine. The problem I had with my solution was the way I wrote 
said logic. I repeated myself too much with writing the code and feel like a better solution is possible, but as of know I couldn't think of it.

## Future features
- Create an AI to allow user to play against computer.
